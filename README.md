This is the git for my project, Project: HomeBound. This game is under development. I've made the main menu, the lobby, and next I will do the city (where will happen the story).
There is a playable version on itch.io (https://bandys.itch.io/project-homebound) and I recommand you to play the downloadable because the saving system doesn't work in the browser version.
While developing this game , I have learnt a lot about unity and C#. I will continue developing this game and I will publish it first on itch.io and then on steam.
